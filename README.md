# hexagonal-coordinates
Hexagonal coordinates can be conveniently modeled as points on the plane x + y + z = 0

These coordinates allow ease of operations such as linear interpolation. They can conveniently be converted back to axial coordinates as necessary. This is an example of linear interpolation on a hexagonal grid using cubic coordinates. The program uses linear interpolation to highlight a line of hexagons between two points. Such a path could be useful for line of sight and movement in a strategy game. It is written in Python and displays results using Pygame.
